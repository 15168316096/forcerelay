# Quick Start

In order to run Forcerelay, please make sure you have all the 
[prerequisites](./pre-requisites.md) installed on your machine.

Once you have these prerequisites, you can
[build and run Forcerelay](./installation.md).

> The instructions in this guide have been tested on `Linux` and `MacOS` 
> environments. Most of the commands should work on both environments. It is
> currently impossible to build and run `Forcerelay` on `Windows`.
