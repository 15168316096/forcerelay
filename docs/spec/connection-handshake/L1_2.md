## L1. Problem statement / outside view

Suppose there are two chains (e.g., distributed ledgers) that execute independently of each other.
What should be an abstraction for representing a path of communication between the two?
We use a _connection_ abstraction to represent this path of communication.

The IBC connection handshake protocol, at the highest level of abstraction, enables two chains to establish a connection with each other [[ICS 003](#references)].
Throughout the rest of this document, we will often use the abbreviation "CH" to stand for _connection handshake_ problem (or protocol, depending on the context).


A connection involves the two _parties_ of the communication (the respective chains), as well as a _relayer_ which handles message transmission between the parties.
The relayer carries a central responsibility in handshaking and maintaining a connection (described below).
That is, a connection handshake is essentially a three-party protocol: an initiating party called Alice, a responder party called Bob, and a relayer Y.


#### Sequential problem statement

###### Definitions
When we speak of a party, we identify three relevant elements:

- a _module_: or the connection handshake module; this is the process which actually implements the CH protocol;
- the _local state_ of the party, sometimes called the _consensus_ state;
- a _client_ residing on that party, which is a window onto the state of the other party.

We give concrete names, Alice and Bob, to the parties involved in our problem.
<!-- We can label one of the modules in our problem as an _initiator_ (or source) module, and a _responder_ (or destination) module. -->


The diagram below sketches the system model of the connection handshake problem. Note that the client on Alice points to the state on Bob; vice versa is true for the client on Bob, but we avoid the arrow to keep it simple.

```

     |+---------+|   --------/           |+---------+|
     || Client  |---/                    || Client  ||
     |+---------+|                       |+---------+|
     +-----------+                       +-----------+
```

###### Problem statement and guarantees
A connection handshake allows, briefly, that two module agree on a consistent view of their state, and each module allocates a new connection associated with this state.
We identify the following high-level requirements that the connection handshake should guarantee:

- **[CH/Seq/1/Agreement]** If Alice finishes a handshake by establishing a new connection `ci` with Bob, and Bob finishes the handshake obtaining the connection `cr`, then `ci == cr`.
In other words, if a connection handshake finishes, the two parties have a consistent view of the connection (one at the initiator and the other at the responder).


- **[CH/Seq/2/Termination]** Eventually, the modules should both finish the handshake, establishing a connection.

Requirement **[CH/Seq/1/Agreement]** represents the basic safety guarantee, while **[CH/Seq/2/Termination]** is the basic liveness guarantee we would like to have.


## L2. Protocol specification / protocol view

In this section we attempt to make the problem specification more concrete.
We define what the processes are, their fault-model, as well as communication and synchrony assumptions.

### 2.1 System model specification

#### System model

A **chain** is a deterministic state machine.
Each chain may be replicated, i.e., consisting of a replicated state machine (RSM), or it may be a standalone process.
In practice, there are certain requirements which each chain must satisfy (e.g., see [[ICS 024](#references)]).
At this level of specification, however, we can assume each chain is a single **process**.

The connection handshake protocol is asymmetric, meaning that the two chains that interact play different roles within the protocol.
We take advantage of this asymmetry and explicitly label one of the chains with `I` (the initiating, or source, process), and the other with `R` (the responder, or destination, process).

On top of each chain, one or multiple **applications** may be running (e.g., payment system or token exchanges, with their associated smart contracts).
In the context of the connection handshake problem, it is an application that invokes the connection handshake protocol, and provides the necessary input for executing this protocol (we give more details on the invocation & input in section [Properties](#properties) below).

At a high-level, the handshake protocol consists of processes `I` and `R` exchanging a few messages called **datagrams**.
Each datagram has a well-defined syntax which we describe later.
__[FIX: describe this and put ref to [2.2 Protocol](#22-protocol).]__

We define a **connection** as a bidirectional or unidirectional path of communication that applications on the initiator and responder chains use to exchange **packets**.
Packets are payloads from the point of view of a connection; they contain arbitrary application-level data, and their content is opaque to a connection; suffice to say that applications generate and consume packets.
To summarize, the purpose of a connection is to enable chains `I` and `R` -- as well as applications running on top of these chains -- to coordinate updates to their state.


###### Communication assumptions
We assume that process `I` and `R` have access to an underlying communication layer (e.g., message passing over TCP/IP) and each process has connectivity with the other.

The code snippet below describes the communication layer API.
This API comprises a function `Send` for invoking the communication layer to send a datagram.
And there is a callback `Deliver` that each process executes upon delivering a datagram from the communication layer.

```golang
type CommunicationLayer interface {
    // A process `s` invokes this function to send a datagram `g` to
    // a destination process `d`.
    Send(g Datagram, d Process) null

    // This callback function triggers at process `d` to deliver datagram `g`
    // that process `s` previously sent.
    Deliver(g Datagram, s Process) null
}
```

- **Expected precondition:**
    - the datagram `g` is non-null;
    - the destination `d` and source `s` processes are non-null;
- **Expected postcondition:** none
- **Error condition:** none

- **Properties of the communication layer:**
    - **[CH/CommAssumption/1/Consistency]** If some process `d` triggers `Deliver(g, s)`, then process `s` previously invoked `Send(g, d)`.
    - **[CH/CommAssumption/2/Termination]** If some process `s` invokes `Send(g, d)`, then eventually the callback`Deliver(g, s)` triggers at process `d`.

Neither of the `Send` or `Deliver` are blocking, and they have no return value.
The communication layer is _asynchronous_: There is no guarantee on how much time it will take for the destination of a datagram to deliver that datagram.


###### Fault assumptions
Processes `I` and `R` may be subject to arbitrary (Byzantine) faults.
The properties we define below are guaranteed to hold iff both `I` and `R` behave correctly, i.e., do not deviate from any protocol we describe below. .
Beside these two processes, the system comprises an arbitrary number of other chains, any of which may be Byzantine; these other chains may, for instance, try to impersonate `I` or `R`.


###### Additional remarks on the system model
We explicitly overlook here two assumptions of synchrony that may be necessary for achieving liveness of **other** protocols, but they are not necessary within the connection handshake protocol.
These assumptions are: (i) partial synchrony is necessary for achieving liveness of a chain if that chain is implemented using a deterministic consensus protocol (e.g., Tendermint Core); (ii) synchrony is necessary for guaranteeing message delivery in any connection-oriented protocol such as TCP, which is most likely the underlying communication layer running between `I` and `R`.


#### Properties

###### Preliminary definitions
We introduce several abstractions that are relevant at this point:

1. A `ConnectionParty` is a data type encapsulating the identifier(s) of a party (either initiator or responder process) involved in a connection.
We can think of `ConnectionParty` as a concrete way of specifying a process in the CH protocol.

```golang
type ConnectionParty interface {
    ConnectionIdentifier    Identifier
    ClientIdentifier        Identifier
    Prefix                  Prefix // TODO -- keep this?
}
```

2. A `ConnectionState` captures the state of a connection, and may have one of the following values. [TODO: not valid Go code below, keep?]

```typescript
enum ConnectionState {
    INIT,
    TRYOPEN,
    OPEN,
}
```

3. A `ConnectionEnd` is a data type that captures all the details of a connection at a party.
One of the goals of the connection handshake protocol is to allocate an object of this type at each of the initiator and responder party.

```golang
type ConnectionEnd interface {
  state                             ConnectionState
  counterpartyConnectionIdentifier  Identifier
  counterpartyPrefix                CommitmentPrefix
  clientIdentifier                  Identifier
  counterpartyClientIdentifier      Identifier
  version                           string | []string
}
```


```golang
type ConnectionEnd interface {
    state      ConnectionState
    initiator  ConnectionParty
    responder  ConnectionParty
    role       ConnectionRole   // either 'initiator' or 'responder'
}
```

Hereafter, when we use the term connection, we refer to the above definition of this type.


We now restate the connection handshake problem in a slightly more precise (or lower level) formulation:
A connection handshake enables two processes to agree on a consistent view of their state, to verify each other's state, and to allocate a new connection.

###### Local state & variables
The local state consists of the following:

- An object (variable) of type `ConnectionEnd`, labeled `c`, initialized to `null` at each of processes `I` and `R`.
- `State` `si` is initialized to `null` at process `I`.
- `State` `sr` is initialized to `null` at process `R`.


###### Inputs
There are three functions that process `I` and `R` have access to:

1. Function `unique(ConnectionEnd c)` takes as input a `ConnectionEnd` `c` and returns true if the input value `c` is unique: if there was no connection established so far with the same `ConnectionEnd`.

2. Function `verify(State s, Process x)` returns true or false.
    - Process `I` invokes this as follows: `verify(si, R)`, where `si` is the representation of the state of process `R` according to process `I`. This function return trues iff `si` passes verification, and false otherwise.
    - The invokation and properties at process `R` is analogous.

3. Function `consistent(State s, Process x)` return true or false. This is similar in purpose and function with `verify`, except is check the consistency of the state `s` as stored locally (at the invoker) with the same state remotely at process `x`.

Furthermore, process `I` receives as input the following:

- `State` `si` and `State` `sr`, representing the state of


###### Guarantees
We refine the safety guarantee **[CH/Seq/1/Agreement]** (defined in the [sequential problem statement](#sequential-problem-statement)) by splitting this into four complementary safety properties:

- **[CH/Proto/1/ConnectionValidity]**
If a module establishes a `Connection` `c`, then `c` is a _valid_ connection; validity is defined by an application-level predicate.

- **[CH/Proto/2/ConnectionUniqueness]**
If a module establishes a connection `c`, no handshake has previously finished for `c`; uniqueness is defined by an application-level predicate.

- **[CH/Proto/3/ConnectionIntegrity]**
If any two modules establish a connection `c`, then either one module or the other or both modules proposed `c`.

- **[CH/Proto/4/StateConsistency]**
If any two modules establish a connection, then the client in the first module is consistent with the state of the second module.

- **[CH/Proto/5/Termination]**
If the initiator and responder are correct, then the connection handshake eventually terminates.

_Remarks and TODOs_:

- We could collapse validity and uniqueness under a single property, since they are both defined through an application predicate. This is not desirable, however, because in the implementation the two properties serve different purposes, so we'll keep them separated.

- Note that property **[CH/Proto/4/StateConsistency]** refers to both modules involved in a connection (both ways). This is because the property applies to _any two modules_ (there is no predefined "first" or "second" module in a connection).

- Be more specific about what does termination imply. Does it mean that both modules allocate a new `ConnectionEnd` (or `Connection`) object?


### 2.2 Protocol

The CH protocol comprises four steps, summarized below.


- An actor invokes `ConnOpenInit` function at the initiator process `I`, which sets off the connection handshake.
- Process `I` sends a datagram named `ConnOpenTry` to process `R`, which handles this via an eponymous handler.
- Process `R` responds to `I` by sending a `ConnOpenAck` datagram, which handles this via `ConnOpenAck` handler.
- Finally, process `I` sends to `R` a `ConnOpenConfirm` datagram, processed by `ConnOpenConfirm` handler.


The diagram below captures the handshake protocol at a high level, comprising the datagrams and handlers.
Note the direction of each arrow, indicating which is the sender and the destination process for each datagram, respectively.

```
               The four steps comprising
             IBC Connection Handshake Protocol

     +-----------+                       +-----------+
     | Initiator |                       | Responder |
     |     I     |                       |     R     |
     |         step 1                    |           |
     |     ConnOpenInit                  |           |
     |           |                       |           |
     |           |-----------------> step 2          |
     |           |               ConnOpenTry         |
     |           |                       |           |
     |        step 3 <-------------------|           |
     |     ConnOpenAck                   |           |
     |           |                       |           |
     |           |                       |           |
     |           |-----------------> step 4          |
     |           |             ConnOpenConfirm       |
     +-----------+                       +-----------+
```



3. A `Proof` is a data type that abstracts over the details of a cryptographic proof that any process can create, and another process can verify.
Intuitively, a proof is helpful for some process `x` to guarantee to another process `y` that `x` is in a certain state.


```golang
type Proof struct {
    Content     MerkleProof // the actual proof
    Path        MerklePath
    Height      uint64
}

```

###### Protocol handlers

```golang
func ConnOpenInit(a ConnectionParty, b ConnectionParty)
```

This function handles the request to initiate a connection handshake between
Alice `a` (the initiator) and Bob `b` (the responder).
This function runs at the CH module of process `a`.



- Preconditions:
    * `i.connectionIdentifier` is valid and unique


```golang
func ConnOpenTry(
  connectionEnd_A Type, proofOfConnectionEnd Type,
  consensusStateB Type, proofOfConsensusStateB Type) {
    if connectionEnd != NilConnection then error

verifyConnectionState(proofOfConnectionEnd, connectionEnd_A) verifyClientConsensusState(proofOfConsensusStateB, consensusStateB)

connectionEnd = createConnectionEnd(connectionEnd_A)
connectionEnd.state = TRYOPEN

consensusStateA = getConsensusState(connectionEnd.clientIdentifier)

send ConnOpenAck( connectionEnd, getProof(connectionEnd), consensusStateA, getProof(consensusStateA))
}
```


###### Algorithms

```golang
func ConnOpenInit(a ConnectionParty, b ConnectionParty)
{
    // validity & uniqueness check for our side of the connection
    validateConnectionIdentifier(i.connectionIdentifier) || abort
    uniqueConnectionIdentifier(i.connectionIdentifier) || abort

    connectionEnd.state = INIT
    connectionEnd.initiator = i
    connectionEnd.responder = r
    connectionEnd.role = "initiator"

    consensusStateB = getConsensusState(connectionEnd.clientIdentifier)

    tryDatagram = ConnHandshakeTry(connectionEnd, getProof(connectionEnd),
        consensusStateB, getProof(consensusStateB))

    Send(tryDatagram, r)
}
```

###### Protocol Invariants


## TODOs & open questions

- What is the interface between an actor and the chain? Seems that the main event for triggering a connection is `connOpenInit` which the Handler implements [ICS 25](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-025-handler-interface).
- Standard cryptographic assumptions (collision-resistant hash functions, public-key signatures)?
- How to capture aborts? or incorrect termination; see [issue raised by Anca](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/42#discussion_r397077901).
- Potentially add support for versions in ConnectionEnd.

## Improvement suggestions

- `ConnHandshakeTry` instead of `ConnOpenTry`. And similar renaming for the other handlers, replacing `Open` with `Handshake`, since this specification is for the connection _handshake_ problem, not the connection _open_ problem.


## L3: Implementation

At this level, we "decapsulate" the abstractions to reduce the amount of data that the relayer reads and writes.
Whenever we would use a `Party` object, for instance, we would replace that with the fields of the `Party` which we actually need (stripping off those fields that are unnecessary).
For example, instead of sending two Party objects around, we send only the relevant fields.

Instead of:
```golang
func ConnOpenTry(
  a Party, b Party,
  ...) {
```

in the actual code, we write:
```golang
func ConnOpenTry(
  desiredIdentifier: Identifier,
  counterpartyConnectionIdentifier: Identifier,
  counterpartyPrefix: CommitmentPrefix,
  counterpartyClientIdentifier: Identifier,
  clientIdentifier: Identifier,
  ...) {
```

In other words, at this level of the spec, the protocol handlers become identical with those in [ICS 003](#references).
This decapsulation step essentially removes any abstractions that might be encumbering at the implementaiton level.
