## L1. Problem statement / outside view

Suppose there are two chains (e.g., distributed ledgers) that execute independently of each other.
What should be a basic abstraction for representing a path of communication between the two?
We use the term _connection_ to represent this path of communication.
The purpose of the IBC connection handshake protocol, at the highest level of abstraction, is to enable two chains to establish a connection with each other [[ICS 003](#references)].
Throughout the rest of this document, we will often use the abbreviation "CH" to stand for "connection handshake" problem (or protocol, depending on the context).

#### Sequential problem statement

Instead of _chains_, at this abstract level of specification we can reason in terms of _processes_.
There are two processes in our problem statement, which we can label explicitly as an _initiator_ (or source) process and a _responder_ (or destination) process.


###### Problem statement and guarantees
A connection handshake allows, briefly, that two processes agree on a consistent view of their state, and each process allocates a new connection associated with this state.
We identify the following requirements that the connection handshake should guarantee:

- **[CH/Seq/1/Agreement]** If the initiator finishes the handshake, establishing a new connection `ci` with the responder, and the responder finishes the handshake obtaining the connection `cr`, then `ci == cr`.
In other words, the two ends of the connection (one at the initiator and the other at the responder) are consistent.


- **[CH/Seq/2/Termination]** Eventually, the two processes should both finish the handshake, establishing a connection.

Requirement **[CH/Seq/1/Agreement]** represents the basic safety guarantee, while **[CH/Seq/2/Termination]** is the basic liveness guarantee we would like to have.

The diagram below sketches the high-level problem statement.

```
                        IBC Connection
     +-----------+    Handshake Protocol    +-----------+
     |           |<-------- step 1 -------->|           |
     | Initiator |    (execute handshake)   | Responder |
     |           |                          |           |
     |          _| (connection established) |_          |
     |         |c|<------------------------>|c|         |
     |          ▔|                          |▔          |
     +-----------+                          +-----------+
```


## L2. Protocol specification / protocol view

In this section we attempt to make the problem specification more concrete.
We define what the processes are, their fault-model, as well as communication and synchrony assumptions.

### 2.1 System model specification

#### System model

A **chain** is a state machine.
Each chain may be replicated, i.e., consisting of a replicated state machine (RSM), or it may be a standalone process.
In practice, there are certain requirements which each chain must satisfy (e.g., see [[ICS 024](#references)]).
At this level of specification, however, we can assume each chain is a single **process**.

The connection handshake protocol is asymmetric, meaning that the two chains that interact play different roles within the protocol.
We take advantage of this asymmetry and explicitly label one of the chains with `I` (the initiating, or source, process), and the other with `R` (the responder, or destination, process).

On top of each chain, one or multiple **applications** may be running (e.g., payment system or token exchanges, with their associated smart contracts).
In the context of the connection handshake problem, it is an application that invokes the connection handshake protocol, and provides the necessary input for executing this protocol (we give more details on the invocation & input in section [2.2 Protocol](#22-protocol) below).

At a high-level, the handshake protocol consists of processes `I` and `R` exchanging a few messages called **datagrams**.
Each datagram has a well-defined syntax which we describe later.
__[FIX: describe this and put ref to [2.2 Protocol](#22-protocol).]__

We define a **connection** as a bidirectional or unidirectional path of communication that applications on the initiator and responder chains use to exchange **packets**.
Packets are payloads from the point of view of a connection; they contain arbitrary application-level data, and their content is opaque to a connection; suffice to say that applications generate and consume packets.
To summarize, the purpose of a connection is to enable chains `I` and `R` -- as well as applications running on top of these chains -- to coordinate updates to their state.


###### Communication assumptions
We assume that process `I` and `R` have access to an underlying communication layer (e.g., message passing over TCP/IP) and each process has connectivity with the other.

The code snippet below describes the communication layer API.
This API comprises a function `Send` for invoking the communication layer to send a datagram.
And there is a callback `Deliver` that each process executes upon delivering a datagram from the communication layer.

```golang
type CommunicationLayer interface {
    // A process `s` invokes this function to send a datagram `g` to
    // a destination process `d`.
    Send(g Datagram, d Process) null

    // This callback triggers at process `d` to deliver datagram `g`
    // that process `s` previously sent.
    Deliver(g Datagram, s Process) null
}
```

Neither of these functions are blocking, and they have no return value.
We also assume that datagrams cannot be tampered with, i.e., they are authenticated by the sender process when calling `Send`.
We assume that the destination process implicitly verifies authenticity upon calling `Deliver` for any datagram.

The communication layer is _asynchronous_.
There is no guarantee on how much time it will take for the destination of a datagram to deliver that datagram.


###### Fault assumptions
This specification operates under the assumption that processes `I` and `R` are not faulty, i.e., do not deviate from any protocol we describe below.
Beside these two processes, the system comprises an arbitrary number of other chains, any of which may be Byzantine; these other chains may, for instance, try to impersonate `I` or `R`.


###### Additional remarks on the system model
We explicitly overlook here two assumptions of synchrony that may be necessary for achieving liveness of **other** protocols, but they are not necessary within the connection handshake protocol.
These assumptions are: (i) partial synchrony is necessary for achieving liveness of a chain if that chain is implemented using a deterministic consensus protocol (e.g., Tendermint Core); (ii) synchrony is necessary for guaranteeing message delivery in any connection-oriented protocol such as TCP, which is most likely the underlying communication layer running between `I` and `R`.


#### Properties

###### Preliminary definitions
We introduce two abstractions that are relevant at this point:

1. A `ConnectionEnd` is a data type (i.e., interface) that abstracts over the details of a connection at a process.
One of the goals of the connection handshake protocol is to  allocate an object of this type at each of the initiator and responder process.

2. A `State` is a data type that abstracts over the details of the state of a process at a current point in time (e.g., a summary or snapshot).
In the context of the CH problem, a process uses this data type to (i) declare their state to another process, and (ii) represent the state of another process.

Knowing the precise declaration of `ConnectionEnd` and `State` is not necessary in understanding the properties of the CH protocol.
Suffice to say that each `ConnectionEnd` has associated the `State` of both the initiator and responder process.
We will declare this data types later (see [2.2 Protocol](#22-protocol)).

We now restate the connection handshake problem in a slightly more precise (or lower level) formulation:
A connection handshake enables two processes to agree on a consistent view of their state, to verify each other's state, and to allocate a new connection.


###### Guarantees
We refine the safety guarantee **[CH/Seq/1/Agreement]**  (defined in the [sequential problem statement](#sequential-problem-statement)) by splitting this into four complementary safety properties:

- **[CH/Proto/1/Uniqueness]**
If a process finishes a handshake for a `ConnectionEnd` `c`, no handshake has previously finished for `c`.

- **[CH/Proto/2/Validity]**
If either of the responder or initiator agree to a `ConnectionEnd` `c`, then the initiator proposed `c`.

- **[CH/Proto/3/StateConsistency]**
If process `i` establishes a connection with some process `r`, then process `i` has the `State` `si` representing process `r` and this state is consistent with the actual state of `r`.

- **[CH/Proto/4/StateVerification]**
If the processes establish a connection  for their respective `State` `si` (state of initiator) and `sr` (state of responder), then the initiator verified `sr` and the responder verified `si`.

The liveness property below is functionally identical to the **[CH/Seq/2/Termination]** property we defined earlier:

- **[CH/Proto/5/Termination]** If the initiator and responder are correct, then the handshake eventually terminates (i.e., both processes allocate a new `ConnectionEnd` object).

**Remarks**.

- Uniqueness.
To guarantee uniqueness, we can assume there is a predicate `unique(v)` that processes invoke to check the uniqueness of input value `v`; this predicate returns true if the input value `v` is unique and otherwise returns false.

- State verification.
Like uniqueness, processes verify each other's state by calling on a predicate `verify(s)` that returns true iff the input state `s` passes verification.

- State consistency.
This property is for ensuring that processes are not out of sync.
This property complements state verification: while verification ensures authenticity on the state of another process (_who_ is the other process), consistency ensures freshness on the state of another process (_what_ is the other process).
We assume there is a predicate `consistent(s)` that returns true iff the input state `s` is consistent.

### 2.2 Protocol

> The following section is work-in-progres..

The CH protocol consists of four datagrams that the initiator and responder exchange.
We enumerate the names of these datagrams in the following code snippet.

```golang
type ConnHandshakeInit struct {  }
type ConnHandshakeTry struct {  }
type ConnHandshakeAck struct {  }
type ConnHandshakeConfirm struct {  }
```

3. A `StateProof` is a data type that abstracts over the details of a cryptographic proof that any process can create, and another process can verify.
Intuitively, a proof is helpful for some process `x` to guarantee to another process `y` that `x` is in a certain state.
Typically, a `StateProof` object is valid with respect to a `State` object.

The diagram below captures the handshake protocol at a high level, comprising the four datagram exchanges.
Note the direction of each arrow, indicating which is the sender and the destination process for each datagram, respectively.

###### Protocol handlers

```golang
// This function handles the request to execute a connection handshake between
// process `i` (the initiator) and remote process (the responder) `r`.
func ConnHandshakeInit(
  identifier Identifier,
  clientIdentifier Identifier, counterParty CounterParty) {
    if connectionEnd != NilConnection then error

    connectionEnd.connectionIdentifier = identifier
    connectionEnd.clientIdentifier = clientIdentifier
    connectionEnd.state = INIT
    connectionEnd.counterParty = counterParty

    consensusStateB = getConsensusState(connectionEnd.clientIdentifier)

    datagram = ConnOpenTry(
    connectionEnd, getProof(connectionEnd),
    consensusStateB, getProof(consensusStateB))
    send (datagram, r)
}
```

```golang
func ConnHandshakeTry(
  connectionEnd_A Type, proofOfConnectionEnd Type,
  consensusStateB Type, proofOfConsensusStateB Type) {
    if connectionEnd != NilConnection then error

verifyConnectionState(proofOfConnectionEnd, connectionEnd_A) verifyClientConsensusState(proofOfConsensusStateB, consensusStateB)

connectionEnd = createConnectionEnd(connectionEnd_A)
connectionEnd.state = TRYOPEN

consensusStateA = getConsensusState(connectionEnd.clientIdentifier)

send ConnOpenAck( connectionEnd, getProof(connectionEnd), consensusStateA, getProof(consensusStateA))
}
```

###### Protocol Invariants


## TODOs & open questions

- What is the interface between an actor and the chain? Seems that the main event for triggering a connection is `connOpenInit` which the Handler implements [ICS 25](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-025-handler-interface).
- Standard cryptographic assumptions (collision-resistant hash functions, public-key signatures)?
- In the IBC terminology, an application is roughly speaking an "actor" [[IBC 1](#references)].
- Unsure if terminology is clear enough, e.g., `data type`...
