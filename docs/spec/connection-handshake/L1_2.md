## L1. Problem statement / outside view

Suppose there are two chains (e.g., distributed ledgers) that execute independently of each other.
What should be an abstraction for representing a path of communication between the two?
We use a _connection_ abstraction to represent this path of communication.

The IBC connection handshake protocol, at the highest level of abstraction, enables two chains to establish a connection with each other [[ICS 003](#references)].
Throughout the rest of this document, we will often use the abbreviation "CH" to stand for _connection handshake_ problem (or protocol, depending on the context).


A connection involves the two _parties_ of the communication (the respective chains), as well as a _relayer_ which handles message transmission between the parties.
The relayer carries a central responsibility in handshaking and maintaining a connection (described below).
That is, a connection handshake is essentially a three-party protocol: a party called Alice, a party called Bob, and a relayer `y`.


#### Sequential problem statement

###### Definitions
When we speak of a party, we identify three relevant elements:

- a _module_: or the connection handshake module; this is the process which actually implements the CH protocol;
- the _local state_ of the party, sometimes called the _consensus_ state;
- a _client_ residing on that party, which is a window onto the state of the other party.

We give concrete names, Alice and Bob, to the parties involved in our problem.
<!-- We can label one of the modules in our problem as an _initiator_ (or source) module, and a _responder_ (or destination) module. -->


The diagram below sketches the system model of the connection handshake problem. Note that the client on Alice points to the state on Bob; vice versa is true for the client on Bob, but we avoid the arrow to keep it simple.

```
                     IBC Connection
                     Handshake Model
     +-----------+                       +-----------+
     |   Chain   |                       |   Chain   |
     |   Alice   |                       |    Bob    |
     | +-------+ |                       | +-------+ |
     | |Module | |                       | |Module | |
     | +-------+ |                       | +-------+ |
     | +-------+ |                       | +-------+ |
     | | State | |                    ---|>| State | |
     | +-------+ |            -------/   | +-------+ |
     |+---------+|   --------/           |+---------+|
     || Client  |---/                    || Client  ||
     |+---------+|                       |+---------+|
     +-----------+                       +-----------+
```

###### Problem statement and guarantees
A connection handshake allows, briefly, that two module agree on a consistent view of their state, and each module allocates a new connection associated with this state.
We identify the following high-level requirements that the connection handshake should guarantee:

- **[CH/Seq/1/Agreement]** If Alice finishes a handshake by establishing a new connection `ci` with Bob, and Bob finishes the handshake obtaining the connection `cr`, then `ci == cr`.
In other words, if a connection handshake finishes, the two parties have a consistent view of the connection (one at the initiator and the other at the responder).


- **[CH/Seq/2/Termination]** Eventually, the modules should both finish the handshake, establishing a connection.

Requirement **[CH/Seq/1/Agreement]** represents the basic safety guarantee, while **[CH/Seq/2/Termination]** is the basic liveness guarantee we would like to have.


## L2. Protocol specification / protocol view

### 2.1 System model specification

#### System model

A **chain** is a deterministic state machine.
Each chain may be replicated, i.e., consisting of a replicated state machine (RSM), or it may be a standalone process.
In practice, there are certain requirements which each chain must satisfy (e.g., see [[ICS 024](#references)]).
At this level of specification, however, we model each chain as consisting of a module, state, and a client.

When we speak of a party or a chain, we typically mean the _module_ executing on that party.

On top of each chain, one or multiple **applications** may be running (e.g., payment system or token exchanges, with their associated smart contracts).
Applications are the high-level entities that require the connection abstraction to be able to build cross-chain logic.
It is not an application that triggers the connection handshake protocol, however; in the IBC terminology, it is an **actor** that invokes the CH protocol and provides the necessary input for executing this protocol (we give more details on the invocation & input below).
An actor may be a relayer or a smart contract, for instance [[IBC terminology](#references)].

At a high-level, the handshake protocol consists of processes `I` and `R` exchanging a few messages called **datagrams**.
Each datagram has a well-defined syntax which we describe later.
__[FIX: describe this and put ref to [2.2 Protocol](#22-protocol).]__

We define a **connection** as a bidirectional or unidirectional path of communication that applications on the initiator and responder chains use to exchange **packets**.
Packets are payloads from the point of view of a connection; they contain arbitrary application-level data, and their content is opaque to a connection; suffice to say that applications generate and consume packets.

To summarize, the purpose of a connection is to enable chains Alice and Bob -- as well as applications running on top of these chains -- to coordinate updates to their state.


###### Communication assumptions
**FIX**

<!-- The relayer `y` serves as a communication medium between the two modules Alice and Bob.
the code snippet below describes the communication layer API between the relayer and each party.


```golang
type CommunicationLayer interface {
    // A module `s` invokes this function to send a datagram `g` to
    // a destination module `d`.
    Set(g Datagram, d Process) null

    // This callback function triggers at module `d` to deliver datagram `g`
    // that module `s` previously sent.
    Deliver(g Datagram, s Process) null
}
``` -->
<!-- We assume that the modules have access to an underlying communication layer (e.g., message passing over TCP/IP) and each module has connectivity with the other.

This API comprises a function `Send` for invoking the communication layer to send a datagram.
And there is a callback `Deliver` that each module executes upon delivering a datagram from the communication layer.


- **Expected precondition:**
    - the datagram `g` is non-null;
    - the destination `d` and source `s` modules are non-null;
- **Expected postcondition:** none
- **Error condition:** none

- **Properties of the communication layer:**
    - **[CH/CommAssumption/1/Integrity]** If some module `d` triggers `Deliver(g, s)`, then module `s` previously invoked `Send(g, d)`.
    - **[CH/CommAssumption/2/Termination]** If some module `s` invokes `Send(g, d)`, then eventually the callback`Deliver(g, s)` triggers at module `d`.

Neither of the `Send` or `Deliver` are blocking, and they have no return value.
The communication layer is _asynchronous_: There is no guarantee on how much time it will take for the destination of a datagram to deliver that datagram. -->


###### Fault assumptions
The chains Alice and Bob (and their modules and client, respectively) may be subject to arbitrary (Byzantine) faults.
The properties we define below are guaranteed to hold iff both Alice and Bob behave correctly, i.e., do not deviate from any protocol we describe below.
Beside these two parties, the system comprises an arbitrary number of other parties, any of which may be Byzantine; these other chains may, for instance, try to impersonate Alice or Bob.
The termination property of the CH protocol depends on the existence of at least one correct relayer.
Additionally, there may be an arbitrary number of relayers that can [FIX] read and write (???) to Alice and Bob and are subject to Byzantine faults.


###### Additional remarks on the system model
We explicitly overlook here two assumptions of synchrony that may be necessary for achieving liveness of **other** protocols, but they are not necessary within the connection handshake protocol.
These assumptions are: (i) partial synchrony is necessary for achieving liveness of a chain if that chain is implemented using a deterministic consensus protocol (e.g., Tendermint Core); (ii) synchrony is necessary for guaranteeing message delivery in any connection-oriented protocol such as TCP, which is most likely the underlying network transport layer running between each module and the relayer.


#### Properties

###### Preliminary definitions
We introduce several abstractions that are relevant at this point:

1. A `ConnectionParty` is a data type encapsulating the details that identify a party.

```golang
type ConnectionParty interface {
  connectionIdentifier    Identifier
  clientIdentifier        Identifier
  prefix                  Prefix
}
```

2. A `ConnectionState` captures the state of a connection, and may have one of the following values.

```typescript
enum ConnectionState {
  INIT,
  TRYOPEN,
  OPEN,
}
```

3. A `ConnectionEnd` is a data type that captures all the details of a connection at a party.
One of the goals of the connection handshake protocol is to allocate an object of this type at each of Alice and Bob.

```golang
type ConnectionEnd interface {
  state                             ConnectionState
  remoteParty                       ConnectionParty
  localParty                        ConnectionParty
  version                           string | []string
}
```

Note that the definition of `ConnectionEnd` includes a _remote_ and a _local_ field; in a specific `ConnectionEnd` object, the local party is the one storing this object, and the remote party is the other one.


4. A `Proof` is a data type that abstracts over the details of a cryptographic proof that any module can create, and another module can verify.
Intuitively, a proof is helpful for some module to guarantee that it is in a certain state.

```golang
type Proof struct {
  Content     CommitmentProof // the actual proof
  Height      uint64
}

```

Further, we also define the interface of a `Store` on each chain, which maintains the state of the chain.
This is a straightforward key/value store.

```golang
type Store interface {
  // Returns the value stored at key `k`, possibly returning null if no value
  // was previously set at key `k`.
  get(k) -> byte[]

  // Sets the value at position `k` to be `v`, overwritting if this key is
  // already present; always returns null (success).
  set(k string, v byte[]) -> null
}
```


We now restate the connection handshake problem in a slightly more precise (or lower level) formulation:
_A connection handshake enables two processes to agree on a consistent view of their state, to verify each other's state, and to allocate a new connection._


<!-- ###### Local state & variables
The local state at a party consists of the following:

- An object (variable) of type `ConnectionEnd`, labeled `c`, initialized to `null`, at each of Alice and Bob.
- `State` `si` is initialized to `null` at process `I`.
- `State` `sr` is initialized to `null` at process `R`. -->


###### Inputs
There are a few functions (predicates) that each module has access to.

- Function `unique(ConnectionEnd c)` takes as input a `ConnectionEnd` `c` and returns true if the input value `c` is unique: if there was no connection established so far with the same `ConnectionEnd`.

- Function `validate(ConnectionEnd c)` verifies the validity of the connection identifier of the local field in the argument `c`.

- Function `pickVersion(counterpartyVersions)` is identical with the one in [ICS 003].


<!-- - Function `verify(State s, Process x)` returns true or false.
    - Process `I` invokes this as follows: `verify(si, R)`, where `si` is the representation of the state of process `R` according to process `I`. This function return trues iff `si` passes verification, and false otherwise.
    - The invokation and properties at process `R` is analogous.

- Function `consistent(State s, Process x)` return true or false. This is similar in purpose and function with `verify`, except is check the consistency of the state `s` as stored locally (at the invoker) with the same state remotely at process `x`. -->


###### Guarantees
We refine the safety guarantee **[CH/Seq/1/Agreement]** (defined in the [sequential problem statement](#sequential-problem-statement)) by splitting this into four complementary safety properties:

- **[CH/Proto/1/ConnectionValidity]**
If a module establishes a connection with `ConnectionEnd` `e`, then `e` is _valid_; validity is defined by an application-level predicate.

- **[CH/Proto/2/ConnectionUniqueness]**
If a module establishes a `ConnectionEnd` `e`, no handshake has previously finished for `e`; uniqueness is defined by an application-level predicate.

- **[CH/Proto/3/ConnectionIntegrity]**
If any two modules establish a connection `e`, then either one module or the other or both modules proposed `e`.

- **[CH/Proto/4/StateConsistency]**
If any two modules establish a connection, then the client in the first module is consistent with the state of the second module.

- **[CH/Proto/5/Termination]**
If the two parties involved in a connection handshake are correct, then the connection handshake eventually terminates.
Specifically, termination implies that each module allocates in the local state a new `ConnectionEnd` object with `state` field set to `OPEN`.


_Remarks and TODOs_:

- We could collapse validity and uniqueness under a single property, since they are both defined through an application predicate.
This is not desirable, however, because in the implementation the two properties serve different purposes, so we should keep them separated.

- Note that property **[CH/Proto/4/StateConsistency]** works both ways.
This property applies to _any two modules_ (there is no predefined "first" or "second" module in a connection).


### 2.2 Protocol

The CH protocol comprises four steps, summarized below.

<!-- - An actor invokes `ConnOpenInit` function at one of the modules, setting off the connection handshake protocol.
In our example, we will use Alice as the party to execute `ConnOpenInit`.
- Alice transitions her sends a datagram named `ConnOpenTry` to process `R`, which handles this via an eponymous handler.
- Process `R` responds to `I` by sending a `ConnOpenAck` datagram, which handles this via `ConnOpenAck` handler.
- Finally, process `I` sends to `R` a `ConnOpenConfirm` datagram, processed by `ConnOpenConfirm` handler. -->


The diagram below captures the handshake protocol at a high level, comprising the datagrams, relayer and handlers.
Note the direction of each arrow, indicating which is the sender and the destination process for each datagram, respectively.

     +-----------+                       +-----------+
```



###### Protocol handlers

We first present the four handler signatures that each connection handshake module implements.

```golang
func ConnOpenInit(local ConnectionParty,
                  remote ConnectionParty)

func ConnOpenTry(local ConnectionParty,
                 remote ConnectionParty,
                 remoteVersions string[],
                 remoteStateProof Proof,
                 remoteClientProof Proof)

func ConnOpenAck(local ConnectionParty,
                 remoteVersion string,
                 remoteStateProof Proof,
                 remoteClientProof Proof)

func ConnOpenConfirm(local ConnectionParty,
                     remoteStateProof Proof)
```



###### Algorithms

```golang
func ConnOpenInit(local ConnectionParty, remote ConnectionParty)
{
  // Create our own end of the connection.
  connectionEnd.state = INIT
  connectionEnd.local = local
  connectionEnd.remote = remote

  // Validity check. Concretely, this checks that the object
  // `connectionEnd.local.connectionIdentifier` is valid. Similar in
  // function with `validateConnectionIdentifier` from [ICS 003].
  abortTransactionUnless(validate(connectionEnd))

  // Uniqueness check.
  abortTransactionUnless(unique(connectionEnd))

  // Now we save this connectionE in our local store.
  // Since this connectionEnd is in state INIT, the relayer will continue with
  // next steps of the connection handshake protocol.
  set(local.connectionIdentifier, connectionEnd)
}
```

<!--   consensusStateB = getConsensusState(connectionEnd.clientIdentifier)
  tryDatagram = ConnHandshakeTry(connectionEnd, getProof(connectionEnd),
      consensusStateB, getProof(consensusStateB)) -->

```golang
func ConnOpenTry(local ConnectionParty,
                 remote ConnectionParty,
                 remoteVersions string[],
                 remoteStateProof Proof,
                 remoteClientProof Proof)
{
  // Create our end of the connection.
  connectionEnd.state = TRYOPEN
  connectionEnd.local = local
  connectionEnd.remote = remote
  connectionEnd.version = pickVersion(remoteVersion)

  // Validity check.
  abortTransactionUnless(validate(connectionEnd))

  // Uniqueness check.
  // Concretely, this verifies that there is no value stored in the local store
  // at key `connectionEnd.local.connectionIdentifier`, OR there is value
  // stored at this key and this value is identical with
  // the object 'connectionEnd'.
  abortTransactionUnless(unique(connectionEnd))

  // This does a complete verification of everything related to proofs.
  // See definition below in helper functions.
  abortTransactionUnless(
    verifyProofs(remoteStateProof, remoteClientProof, connectionEnd))

  // Handler is done: store the connectionEnd and let the relayer handle
  // the next step.
  set(local.connectionIdentifier, connectionEnd)
}
```

```golang
func ConnOpenAck(local ConnectionParty,
                 remoteVersion string,
                 remoteStateProof Proof,
                 remoteClientProof Proof)
{
  // Search the details of this connection in our local store.
  connectionEnd = get(local.connectionIdentifier)

  // This verification helps guarantee integrity:
  // [CH/Proto/3/ConnectionIntegrity].
  abortTransactionUnless(connectionEnd != nil
                         && connectionEnd.local == local)

  // Another integrity check: we should not overwrite a connection that is
  // already open. At first glance, it seems that we can actually drop this
  // verification without any harm. Note we already checked above (implicitly) 
  // that the connectionEnd is in state INIT or TRYOPEN. Still, not 100% we 
  // can drop this check -- never hurts to be cautious.
  abortTransactionUnless(connectionEnd.state == INIT
                         || connectionEnd.state == TRYOPEN)

  // Verification of proofs. See definition below in helper functions.
  abortTransactionUnless(
    verifyProofs(remoteStateProof, remoteClientProof, connectionEnd))

  // Another integrity check: We should not open a connection unless it is for
  // a version that we agree with.
  abortTransactionUnless(getCompatibleVersions().indexOf(remoteVersion) !== -1)

  // Termination (partial -- only at this end)
  connectionEnd.state = OPEN

  // Update the connectionEnd in our state.
  set(local.connectionIdentifier, connectionEnd)
}
```


```golang
func ConnOpenConfirm(local ConnectionParty,
                     remoteStateProof Proof)
{
  // Search the details of this connection in our local store.
  connectionEnd = get(local.connectionIdentifier)

  // Helps guarantee integrity [CH/Proto/3/ConnectionIntegrity].
  abortTransactionUnless(connectionEnd != nil
                         && connectionEnd.local == local)

  // Integrity check: we should not overwrite a connection that is
  // already OPEN. And we should not be working with a connection that is 
  // INIT. The only acceptable state is TRYOPEN.
  abortTransactionUnless(connectionEnd.state == TRYOPEN)

  // Verification of proofs. See definition below in helper functions.
  abortTransactionUnless(
    verifyProofs(remoteStateProof, nil, connectionEnd))

  // Termination.
  connectionEnd.state = OPEN
  set(local.connectionIdentifier, connectionEnd)
}
```

###### Helper functions

```golang
func verifyProofs(remoteStateProof Proof, 
                  remoteClientProof Proof,
                  connectionEnd ConnectionEnd)
  // Two syntactic check: for each proof, verify that it is authentic.
  // This return either true (success) or false (failure).
  // It is also acceptable that this function triggers an abort (e.g., due to
  // malformed input).
  t = verifyProofAuthenticity(remoteStateProof, connectionEnd)
  if t == false {
    return false
  }
  if remoteClientProof != nil {
    // This return either true (success) or false (failure). Aborting is also
    // acceptable.
    t = verifyProofAuthenticity(remoteClientProof, connectionEnd)
    if t == false {
      return false
    }
  }

  // Semantic checks of both proofs: interpret proof content and verify that
  // they make sense with respect to connection handshake protocol and our
  // state.
  // 1. Verify that the remote party has performed the 'INIT' step for this
  // specific connectionEnd. This helps guarantee the property
  // [CH/Proto/3/ConnectionIntegrity].
  // May trigger an abort if the verification fails. Usually returns true
  // or false.
  t = verifyRemoteState(remoteStateProof, ConnectionEnd)
  if t == false {
    return false
  }
  // 2. Verify that the client on the remote party is consistent with my state.
  // It seems that remoteStateProof is necessary for this step. This also
  // checks, among others, that remoteClientProof.height <= getCurrentHeight()
  // cf. [ICS 003].
  if remoteClientProof != nil {
    // May trigger an abort if the verification fails. Usually returns true
    // or false.
    t = verifyRemoteClient(
        remoteClientProof [,remoteStateProof], ConnectionEnd)
    if t == false {
      return false
    }
  }
  return true
```

Preconditions:
  - `remoteClientProof` may be nil
  - `remoteStateProof` and `connectionEnd` have to be well-former and non-nil

Postconditions:
  - returns true upon success, false if any verification failed.
  - if any of the preconditions are violated, the function may abort.


## TODOs & open questions

- What is the interface between an actor and the chain? Seems that the main event for triggering a connection is `connOpenInit` which the Handler implements [ICS 25](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-025-handler-interface).
- Standard cryptographic assumptions (collision-resistant hash functions, public-key signatures)?
- How to capture aborts? or incorrect termination; see [issue raised by Anca](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/42#discussion_r397077901).
- **Verification of the unbonding period** in `ConnOpenTry`.
- add more details, pre- and post-conditions to all functions.


## Improvement suggestions

- `ConnHandshakeTry` instead of `ConnOpenTry`. And similar renaming for the other handlers, replacing `Open` with `Handshake`, since this specification is for the connection _handshake_ problem, not the connection _open_ problem.


## L3: Implementation

At this level, we "decapsulate" the abstractions to reduce the amount of data that the relayer reads and writes.
Whenever we would use a `Party` object, for instance, we would replace that with the fields of the `Party` which we actually need (stripping off those fields that are unnecessary).
For example, instead of sending two Party objects around, we send only the relevant fields.

Instead of:
```golang
func ConnOpenTry(
  a Party, b Party,
  ...) {
```

in the actual code, we write:
```golang
func ConnOpenTry(
  desiredIdentifier: Identifier,
  counterpartyConnectionIdentifier: Identifier,
  counterpartyPrefix: CommitmentPrefix,
  counterpartyClientIdentifier: Identifier,
  clientIdentifier: Identifier,
  ...) {
```

In other words, at this level of the spec, the protocol handlers become identical with those in [ICS 003](#references).
This decapsulation step essentially removes any abstractions that might be encumbering at the implementaiton level.
