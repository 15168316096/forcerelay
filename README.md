Synapse Relayer aims to allow [CKB](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb)
and chains built on [Axon](https://github.com/axonweb3/axon) gain the ability to
interact with Ethereum and Cosmos-SDK chains via [IBC protocol](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc).

Synapse Relayer is based on [Hermes](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes), which helps Cosmos-SDK chains to interact with each other. Many thanks to them!
